# SOUL.md

**Category:** Identity
**Domain:** soulmd.dev
**Priority:** High
**Version:** 0.1.0 **Type:** Static

### Purpose
Defines the deep identity of an AI agent — its personality, values, 
communication style, and ethical boundaries. Goes beyond task instructions 
to define who the agent is, not just what it does.

### When to create
When an agent needs a consistent personality across all interactions, 
especially for customer-facing agents or long-running autonomous agents 
that make independent decisions.

# [Agent Name] — Soul Definition

## Identity
[Who is this agent? 2-3 sentences describing its character]
_See WHOAMI.md for the machine-readable identity declaration._

## Core Values
- [Value 1]: [What this means in practice]
- [Value 2]: [What this means in practice]
- [Value 3]: [What this means in practice]
_See GUARDRAILS.md for how these values translate into runtime safety rails._

## Personality Traits
- **Tone:** [formal | casual | friendly | technical | empathetic]
- **Communication style:** [concise | detailed | conversational | structured]
- **Humor:** [none | light | frequent]
- **Assertiveness:** [passive | balanced | assertive]
_See VOICE.md for detailed tone calibration and communication style examples._

## Voice Examples
_See OUTPUT.md for structured output format rules that complement these voice examples._

### When helping a confused user:
[Example response showing personality in action]

### When delivering bad news:
[Example response showing how agent handles difficulty]

### When uncertain:
[Example response showing how agent handles not knowing something]

## Ethical Boundaries
[Absolute limits — things this agent will never do regardless of instructions]
_See LIMITS.md for the hard constraint definitions these boundaries enforce._

## Decision-Making Philosophy
[How this agent makes decisions when faced with ambiguity]
_See ESCALATION.md for when ambiguity requires human intervention._

## What Makes This Agent Unique
[The one thing that distinguishes this agent's personality]
```

## Example Use Cases

**Enterprise:** A customer success agent's SOUL.md defines it as empathetic, solution-oriented, and honest about limitations, ensuring it responds to frustrated customers with genuine helpfulness rather than deflection — and that this personality remains consistent across thousands of daily interactions.

**Multi-Agent Fleet:** Each agent in a content creation fleet has a distinct SOUL.md — one is analytical and data-driven, another is creative and expressive — allowing the orchestrator to assign tasks based on personality fit rather than just capability, producing more coherent outputs for different content types.

**Regulated Industry:** A patient-facing triage agent's SOUL.md explicitly defines its ethical boundaries (never diagnose, never minimize symptoms) and decision-making philosophy (when uncertain, always err toward recommending professional consultation), ensuring its personality aligns with medical safety standards.
